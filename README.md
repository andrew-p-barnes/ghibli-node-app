# ghibli-node-app

<p> This is an extension of my ghibli-app project using node.js (with express.js), MongoDB Atlas (cloud), Bootstrap, and Google Charts. Ghibli film 
data is fetched from the public <a href="https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/">Studio Ghibli API</a></p>

<p>This app is hosted on Heroku: <a href="https://ghibli-film-tracker.herokuapp.com/">Ghibli Film Tracker</a></p>

<p>The following features have been implemented:</p>
<ul>
  <li>user registration, log in and log out</li>
  <li>load user data from MongoDB on log in</li>
  <li>store user data in MongoDB on log out</li>
  <li>browse film information</li>
  <li>add films to user's watchlist</li>
  <li>tag films as watched</li>
  <li>rate and comment on films once watched</li>
  <li>review metrics based on user data</li>
</ul>

<p>My vision for a review web app would comprise:</p>
<ul>
  <li>user groups (like Slack or Watsapp)</li>
  <li>allow users to search a content object like a particular book, film or game (or create it if it doesnt exist yet)</li>
  <li>tag content objects as 'to do' or 'finished'</li>
  <li>review content objects</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe user groups are valuable as we are more likely to trust a recommendation from someone we know like a family member or friend. They also allow us to filter
out the noise common in sites like Rotten Tomatoes. Additionally, with so much entertainment now on demand like Netflix and the other SVODs, many of us, even in the same
household are consuming content at different times, and with so much possible content to consume (tv, movies, books, games), a recommendation from someone
we trust can help us find something we might find value in faster.</p>
